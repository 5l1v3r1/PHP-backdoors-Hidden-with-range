# PHP backdoors : Hidden with range
PHP backdoors : Hidden with range & Simple Backdoor :)

# About
This is my new experiment where I create a backdoor with functions that exist in php. I try to create new things that people have not created yet. My target is that everyone will create a backdoor with my model.

# How to work : 
* Run the file on the web server or in cmd / terminal : php encode.php for encode and for decode decode-and-run.php
